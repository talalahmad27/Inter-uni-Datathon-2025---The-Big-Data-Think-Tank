# **Inter-uni Datathon 2025 ‚Äì The Big Data Think Tank**

This repository contains our solution for the Inter-uni Datathon 2025 challenge. The project involves data analysis and predictive modeling to identify the best ski resorts and the optimal time for a ski vacation.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- Final Source code.ipynb: The main notebook with complete analysis and the LSTM model.
‚Äì Contains all datasets used for the project.

‚ö†Ô∏è Please ensure that all files are in the same directory as the notebook before execution.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Project Overview**

We performed an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) and built a predictive model to assist travelers and ski enthusiasts in planning better vacations.

## üîç **Analysis**

We extracted insights across multiple factors such as:

- Accommodation Costs ‚Äì Trends in lodging prices across different resorts.

- Ease of Travel ‚Äì Accessibility of ski resorts based on location and infrastructure.

- Weather Conditions ‚Äì Impact of climate and snowfall on ski experiences.

- Popularity ‚Äì Visitor patterns and demand trends across destinations.

## ü§ñ **Forecasting Model**

Implemented an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to forecast:

- Best ski resorts to visit to next year.

- Optimal time window for planning ski vacations in the upcoming year.
